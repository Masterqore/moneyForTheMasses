How will such a blockchain reach consensus while simultaneously allowing all citizens equal rights to participate in the verification process, allocate mining rewards (or in POS staking rewards) evenly without prejedice?

How will the consensus algorithm prevent centralisation of mining or staking power?

Will consensus require identity? how will identity degrade the free and open nature of the system

Does it make sense, if identity is the most logical way to achieve decentralisation, that some kind of public citizenship register is also incorporated as an option to the architecture.
i.e. the system can be easily upgraded to also be a citizenship register.

Any other questions?
I have jsut jotted down the ones off the top of my head
