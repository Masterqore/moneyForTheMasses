As we careen toward the 3rd economic crisis of this millenium, it is clearer than ever that the financial architecture dominateing today is both not well suited to a global dynamic economy, and also degraded significantly due to its shortcomings. The equivalent of a substandard sandwitch, packed badly and not refrigirated on a hot day.

What is also becoming clearer is that the authorities who select themselves for the job of stewards of the current global economy, also carry disturbing conflicts of interest which place impossible circumstances around their decisions. Such conflicts are not accidental and an argument could be easily constructed that they are intentional, and part of the design, rather than some unfortunate but wholy unavoidable side effects of the best system possible.

Bitcoin showed the world that an emotionless and absoultely rules based economy is not only possible, but is in fact greatly fairer than the current wastfull and corrupt system.
The clones and inspired projects that Bitcoin ushered, may have not replicated the impossible complexity of our current global economic architecture, but they have sufficiently shown that they can offer an alternative to many processes which currently inherit disturbing levels of conflicts of interest. Further, they have shown that extending their work could conceivably replace the corrupted workings of our current paradigm with a far fairer, faster and more invisible financial framework based on free and open blockchains.

So the mission is to marshall the crypto community into the project to specify the workings of a peoples crypto. A daily unit of accounts and transactions which operates in the manner of Bitcoin. The system should make every citizen a node, a miner, and a user.
